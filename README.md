# The-VBA-of-Wall-Street
VBA of Wall Street is about utilizing VBA scripting and analyze three years real stock market data. 

## Challenge 1 - Easy:

* Create a script that will loop through one year of stock data for each run and return the total volume each stock had over that year.
* Display the ticker symbol to coincide with the total stock volume.

## Challenge 2 - Moderate

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks and take the following info.
* Yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was.
* The percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed.
* The total Volume of the stock
* Ticker symbol
* Include conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

## Challenge 3 - Hard:

* The solution will include everything from the moderate challenge.
* The solution will also be able to locate the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
* Make the appropriate adjustments to the script that will allow it to run on every worksheet just by running it once.
